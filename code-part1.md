The directory contains the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the HTML file that structures the webpage.
- `style.css`: This is the CSS file that styles the webpage.
- `main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file that provides functionality to the webpage. This is where the bulk of the trivia game logic is implemented.
- `users.json`: This is a JSON file that contains data about the users.
- `modal.js`: This JavaScript file handles the functionality of a modal (a type of dialog box/pop-up) on the webpage.
- `questions.json`: This is a JSON file that contains the trivia questions.
- `assets`: This is a directory containing the media files used on the webpage.

Let's read the `main.js` file

Here's a high-level overview of what the code does:

1. Imports the JSON files which contain the questions and users.

2. Gets all the necessary DOM elements from the HTML file. These elements are then manipulated in JavaScript to create the game's functionality.

3. Creates several arrays and sets from the DOM elements and the imported JSON files. These collections are used to manage the game's questions, user interactions, and game statistics.

4. Declares several variables to store the current game state, such as the current user, running score, and current question.

5. Defines several helper functions to manage game state, validate user input, and update game statistics.

6. Adds event listeners to various DOM elements to handle user interactions such as clicking on buttons and entering input.

7. In the end, adds a click listener to the "Play Again" button which reloads the page when clicked.

Let's break it down in more detail. Here are the key parts of the code:

### Importing JSON files

```javascript
import questions from './questions.json' assert { type: 'json' }
import users from './users.json' assert { type: 'json' }
```

These lines import JSON files that contain the questions for the trivia game and user data, respectively. The `assert { type: 'json' }` part is an assertion that ensures the imported file is a JSON file.

### Getting DOM elements

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.container')
...
const answerButtons = document.querySelectorAll('.answer')
...
```

These lines get various DOM (Document Object Model) elements that the JavaScript will need to manipulate. The `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` methods are used to select elements from the HTML document using their CSS selectors.

### Creating collections from DOM elements and JSON objects

```javascript
const answers = [...answerButtons]
...
const questionsKeysArray = Object.keys(questions)
...
const randomTen = new Set()
...
```

These lines create various collections (arrays and sets) from the DOM elements and the imported JSON objects. These collections are used to manage the game's questions, user interactions, and game statistics.

### Declaring game state variables

```javascript
let currentUser
...
let runningScore = 0
...
let currentQuestion
...
```

These lines declare several variables to store the current state of the game. For example, `currentUser` stores the current user's username, `runningScore` stores the user's score, and `currentQuestion` stores the current question.

### Defining helper functions

```javascript
const setStartGameInvalidState = () => {
...
}

const userExists = (username) => {
...
}

const checkAnswer = (question, userAnswer, correct) => {
...
}

const loadQuestionAndAnswers = () => {
...
}
```

These are helper functions defined to manage the game state, validate user input, update game statistics, and load questions and answers. They are used in various parts of the code to perform these tasks.

### Adding event listeners

```javascript
nextSectionTriggers.forEach((trigger) => {
  trigger.addEventListener('click', (e) => nextSectionClickListener(e))
})

answers.forEach((answer) => {
  answer.addEventListener('click', (e) => toggleSelectIndicator(e))
})

usernameInput.addEventListener('input', checkUsernameValidity)
usernameInput.addEventListener('blur', checkUsernameValidity)

playAgainBtn.addEventListener('click', () => window.location.reload())
```

These lines add event listeners to various DOM elements. When the user interacts with these elements (for example, by clicking a button or entering input), the corresponding event listener function is triggered. For instance, when the "Play Again" button is clicked, the page is reloaded.
